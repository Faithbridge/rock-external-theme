            <h2>A Place Where Kids Learn About Jesus On Their Level</h2>
            <p><b>Every Sunday, babies through fifth-grade kids experience safe, age-appropriate environments where the Bible is taught in a creative and relevant way.</b></p>
            <p>We would love for you and your family to visit KidSpring this Sunday. Join the fun, and experience a world where kids meet Jesus on their level!</p>

            <hr class="tiny">

            <h2>Your First Visit</h2>
            <p><b>From the moment you pull in the parking lot, you’ll notice lots of friendly faces eager to show you the way.</b></p>
            <p><mark>Your first stop when you arrive is the first-time check in area.</mark></p> 
            <p>We want to serve you and your child well, so we’ll take some time to get to know you. We’ll ask about allergies, make sure we know what your child likes to be called, and collect your contact information.</p>
            <p><mark>Then, you and your child will both get a sticker with a matching code.</mark></p> 
            <p>If for any reason we need to reach you during the gathering, you’ll see your kid’s code in the lower corner of the screen. This sticker is also what you’ll use to pick-up your child after gathering.</p>
