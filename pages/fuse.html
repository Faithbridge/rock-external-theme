            <h2>What is Fuse?</h2>
            <p>Fuse is the student ministry of NewSpring Church. At Fuse, middle and high school students hear the Gospel and have a whole lot of fun. Fuse is a place where students connect with God, with other students, and with older committed leaders who want to help them follow Jesus.</p>
